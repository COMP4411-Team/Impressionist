Impressionist Bells and Whistles checklist for grading
(submit with your project ONLY if you have implemented any of the following B&Ws)

HKUST login(s): bhuai, hqinac

Delete yes/no when appropriate			

All but the video are finished

W per new brush					yes	NOTE: not sure whether or not new brushes in the following bells can be double-counted :)
W border clipping					yes
W (red) marker					yes
W swap						yes
B RGB scale					yes	NOTE: is under file->color. Different from what prof mentioned (simply scale the RGB value)
							           but is the same as the solution provided, this does interpolation between original value and 255, 
							           coeffcients are picked from the pallet

B blur/sharp brush					yes	NOTE: only sharpening
B 1 level undo					yes
B dissolve						yes	NOTE: is under file->dissolve, alpha setting under file->dissolve setting
BW fade in/out input on output canvas			yes
BW mural (blending)				yes
BW alpha brush					yes
BW automatic paint whole image			yes
BW gradient from user-specified image			yes	NOTE:For the light button anotherGradient, please first use file->load Gradient Map to load the map for another Gradient,
                                                                                                                          or the light button will automatically call it( if gradient map = nullptr). similarly, for the light button edge clipping, 
                                                                                                                          you can use both file->load Edge Image and edge detection, edge detection will save the edge image automatically.
                                                                                                                          If Edge image==nullptr, the light button will call load edge Image.
BW edge clipping					yes
2B user-specified kernel				yes
2B edge detection + user-specified edge clipping		yes
2B multiresolution					yes	NOTE: changing presets will not reflect on the slider value, but they do change
							           also there

2B warp brush					yes	NOTE: try swiftly holding and dragging the cursor for best effect
2B curved brush following image gradient		yes	NOTE: brush size 2 or 3 will achieve best visual result
4B mosaic					yes	NOTE: thumbnails under image/thumbnails, only 10x10px bmp will be accepted, need more than 100 thumbnails as input
4B impressionist video with temporal coherency		no
8B Bayesian matting				yes	NOTE: output in alpha matte, better result please check KNN matting
*Extra KNN matting						CAVEAT: also under file->matting, ***please switch to release mode and enable O2 optimization for best performance***

Matting usage: click "annotate foreground" and try to fill as much "groundtruth" foreground as possible, same for "annotate background"
We don't use grey as the uncertain region for the trimap, anything other than black and white will be the uncertain part
For Bayessian matting, the full filling is vital because of the its principle (especially at the corners or edges)
For KNN matting, there is no such restriction. It also significantly outperforms Bayessian matting in our own implementations.
